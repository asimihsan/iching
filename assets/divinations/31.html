     The Judgement

          Influence. Success.
          Perseverance furthers.
          To take a maiden to wife brings good fortune.

     The Image

          A lake on the mountain:
          The image of Influence.
          Thus the superior man encourages people to approach him
          By his readiness to receive them.

          Perseverance brings good fortune.
          Remorse disappears.
          If a man is agitated in mind,
          And his thoughts go hither and thither,
          Only those friends
          On whom he fixes his conscious thoughts
          Will follow.
