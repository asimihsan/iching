     The Judgement

          Opposition. In small matters, good fortune.

     The Image

          Above, fire; below, the lake:
          The image of Opposition.
          Thus amid all fellowship
          The superior man retains his individuality.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          Remorse disappears.
          If you lose your horse, do not run after it;
          It will come back of its own accord.
          When you see evil people,
          Guard yourself against mistakes.

     ()   Nine in the second place means:
          One meets his lord in a narrow street.
          No blame.

          Six in the third place means:
          One sees the wagon dragged back,
          The oxen halted,
          A man's hair and nose cut off.
          Not a good beginning, but a good end.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          Isolated through opposition,
          One meets a like-minded man
          With whom one can associate in good faith.
          Despite the danger, no blame.

     ()   Six in the fifth place means:
          Remorse disappears.
          The companion bites his way through the wrappings.
          If one goes to him,
          How could it be a mistake?

          Nine at the top means:
          Isolated through opposition,
          One sees one's companion as a pig covered with dirt,
          As a wagon full of devils.
          First one draws a bow against him,
          Then one lays the bow aside.
          He is not a robber; he will woo at the right time.
          As one goes, rain falls; then good fortune comes.
