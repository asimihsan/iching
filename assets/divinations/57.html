     The Judgement

          The Gentle. Success through what is small.
          It furthers one to have somewhere to go.
          It furthers one to see the great man.

     The Image

          Winds following one upon the other:
          The image of the Gently Penetrating.
          Thus the superior man
          Spreads his commands abroad
          And carries out his undertakings.

     The Lines

     []   Six at the beginning means:
          In advancing and in retreating,
          The perseverance of a warrior furthers.

          Nine in the second place means:
          Penetration under the bed.
          Priests and magicians are used in great number.
          Good fortune. No blame.

          Nine in the third place means:
          Repeated penetration. Humiliation.

     []   Six in the fourth place means:
          Remorse vanishes.
          During the hunt
          Three kinds of game are caught.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          Perseverance brings good fortune.
          Remorse vanishes.
          Nothing that does not further.
          No beginning, but an end.
          Before the change, three days.
          After the change, three days.
          Good fortune.

          Nine at the top means:
          Penetration under the bed.
          He loses his property and his ax.
          Perseverance brings misfortune.
