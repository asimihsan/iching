     The Judgement

          Keeping Still. Keeping his back still
          So that he no longer feels his body.
          He goes into his courtyard
          And does not see his people.
          No blame.

     The Image

          Mountains standing close together:
          The image of Keeping Still.
          Thus the superior man
          Does not permit his thoughts
          To go beyond his situation.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          Keeping his toes still.
          No blame.
          Continued perseverance furthers.

          Six in the second place means:
          Keeping his calves still.
          He cannot rescue him whom he follows.
          His heart is not glad.

          Nine in the third place means:
          Keeping his hips still.
          Making his sacrum stiff.
          Dangerous. The heart suffocates.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          Keeping his trunk still.
          No blame.

          Six in the fifth place means:
          Keeping his jaws still.
          The words have order.
          Remorse disappears.

     ()   Nine at the top means:
          Noblehearted keeping still.
          Good fortune.
