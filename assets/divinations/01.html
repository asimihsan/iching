     The Judgement

          The Creative works sublime success,
          Furthering through perseverance.

     The Image

          The movement of heaven is full of power.
          Thus the superior man makes himself strong and untiring.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          Hidden dragon. Do not act.

          Nine in the second place means:
          Dragon appearing in the field.
          It furthers one to see the great man.

          Nine in the third place means:
          All day long the superior man is creatively active.
          At nightfall his mind is still beset with cares.
          Danger. No blame.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          Wavering flight over the depths.
          No blame.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          Flying dragon in the heavens.
          It furthers one to see the great man.

          Nine at the top means:
          Arrogant dragon will have cause to repent.

          When all the lines are nines, it means:
          There appears a flight of dragons without heads.
          Good fortune.
