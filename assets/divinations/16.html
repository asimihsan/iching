     The Judgement

          Enthusiasm. It furthers one to install helpers
          And to set armies marching.

     The Image

          Thunder comes resounding out of the earth:
          The image of Enthusiasm.
          Thus the ancient kings made music
          In order to honor merit,
          And offered it with splendor
          To the Supreme Deity,
          Inviting their ancestors to be present.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          Enthusiasm that expresses itself
          Brings misfortune.

          Six in the second place means:
          Firm as a rock. Not a whole day.
          Perseverance brings good fortune.

          Six in the third place means:
          Enthusiasm that looks upward creates remorse.
          Hesitation brings remorse.

     ()   Nine in the fourth place means:
          The source of enthusiasm.
          He achieves great things.
          Doubt not.
          You gather friends around you
          As a hair clasp gathers the hair.

          Six in the fifth place means:
          Persistently ill, and still does not die.

          Six at the top means:
          Deluded enthusiasm.
          But if after completion one changes,
          There is no blame.
