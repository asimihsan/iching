     The Judgement

          Preponderance of the Great.
          The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.
          It furthers one to have somewhere to go.
          Success.

     The Image

          The lake rises above the trees:
          The image of Preponderance of the Great.
          Thus the superior man, when he stands alone,
          Is unconcerned,
          And if he has to renounce the world,
          He is undaunted.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          To spread white rushes underneath.
          No blame.

     ()   Nine in the second place means:
          A dry poplar sprouts at the root.
          An older man takes a young wife.
          Everything furthers.

          Nine in the third place means:
          The ridgepole sags to the breaking point.
          Misfortune.

     ()   Nine in the fourth place means:
          The ridgepole is braced. Good fortune.
          If there are ulterior motives, it is humiliating.

          Nine in the fifth place means:
          A withered poplar puts forth flowers.
          An older woman takes a husband.
          No blame. No praise.

          Six at the top means:
          One must go through the water.
          It goes over one's head.
          Misfortune. No blame.
