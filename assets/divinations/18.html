          After the starting point, three days.

     The Image

          The wind blows low on the mountain:
          The image of Decay.
          Thus the superior man stirs up the people
          And strengthens their spirit.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.
          If there is a son,
          No blame rests upon the departed father.
          Danger. In the end good fortune.

          Nine in the second place means:
          Setting right what has been spoiled by the mother.
          One must not be too persevering.

          Nine in the third place means:
          Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.
          There will be little remorse. No great blame.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          Tolerating what has been spoiled by the father.
          In continuing one sees humiliation.

     ()   Six in the fifth place means:
          Setting right what has been spoiled by the father.
          One meets with praise.

          Nine at the top means:
          He does not serve kings and princes,
          Sets himself higher goals.
