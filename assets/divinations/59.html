     The Judgement

          Dispersion. Success.
          The king approaches his temple.
          It furthers one to cross the great water.
          Perseverance furthers.

     The Image

          The wind drives over the water:
          The image of Dispersion.
          Thus the kings of old sacrificed to the Lord
          And built temples.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          He brings help with the strength of a horse.
          Good fortune.

     []   Nine in the second place means:
          At the dissolution
          He hurries to that which supports him.
          Remorse disappears.

          Six in the third place means:
          He dissolves his self. No remorse.

     []   Six in the fourth place means:
          He dissolves his bond with his group.
          Supreme good fortune.
          Dispersion leads in turn to accumulation.
          This is something that ordinary men do not think of.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          His loud cries are as dissolving as sweat.
          Dissolution. A king abides without blame.

          Nine at the top means:
          He dissolves his blood.
          Departing, keeping at a distance, going out,
          Is without blame.
