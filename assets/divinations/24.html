     The Judgement

          Return. Success.
          Going out and coming in without error.
          Friends come without blame.
          To and fro goes the way.
          On the seventh day comes return.
          It furthers one to have somewhere to go.

     The Image

          Thunder within the earth:
          The image of the Turning Point.
          Thus the kings of antiquity closed the passes
          At the time of solstice.
          Merchants and strangers did not go about,
          And the ruler
          Did not travel through the provinces.

     The Lines

     ()   Nine at the beginning means:
          Return from a short distance.
          No need for remorse.
          Great good fortune.

          Six in the second place means:
          Quiet return. Good fortune.

          Six in the third place means:
          Repeated return. Danger. No blame.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          Walking in the midst of others,
          One returns alone.

          Six in the fifth place means:
          Noblehearted return. No remorse.

          Six at the top means:
          Missing the return. Misfortune.
          Misfortune from within and without.
          If armies are set marching in this way,
          One will in the end suffer a great defeat,
          Disastrous for the ruler of the country.
          For ten years
          It will not be possible to attack again.
