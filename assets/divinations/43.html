     The Judgement

          Break-through. One must resolutely make the matter known
          At the court of the king.
          It must be announced truthfully. Danger.
          It is necessary to notify one's own city.
          It does not further to resort to arms.
          It furthers one to undertake something.

     The Image

          The lake has risen up to heaven:
          The image of Break-through.
          Thus the superior man
          Dispenses riches downward
          And refrains from resting on his virtue.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          Mighty in the forward-striding toes.
          When one goes and is not equal to the task,
          One makes a mistake.

          Nine in the second place means:
          A cry of alarm. Arms at evening and at night.
          Fear nothing.

          Nine in the third place means:
          To be powerful in the cheekbones
          Brings misfortune.
          The superior man is firmly resolved.
          He walks alone and is caught in the rain.
          He is bespattered,
          And people murmur against him.
          No blame.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          There is no skin on his thighs,
          And walking comes hard.
          If a man were to let himself be led like a sheep,
          Remorse would disappear.
          But if these words are heard
          They will not be believed.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          In dealing with weeds,
          Firm resolution is necessary.
          Walking in the middle
          Remains free of blame.

     []   Six at the top means:
          No cry.
          In the end misfortune comes.
