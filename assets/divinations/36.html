     The Judgement

          Darkening of the Light. In adversity
          It furthers one to be persevering.

     The Image

          The light has sunk into the earth:
          The image of Darkening of the Light.
          Thus does the superior man live with the great mass:
          He veils his light, yet still shines.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          Darkening of the light during flight.
          He lowers his wings.
          The superior man does not eat for three days
          On his wanderings.
          But he has somewhere to go.
          The host has occasion to gossip about him.

     ()   Six in the second place means:
          Darkening of the light injures him in the left thigh.
          He gives aid with the strength of a horse.
          Good fortune.

          Nine in the third place means:
          Darkening of the light during the hunt in the south.
          Their great leader is captured.
          One must not expect perseverance too soon.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          He penetrates the left side of the belly.
          One gets at the very heart of the darkening of the light,
          And leaves gate and courtyard.

     ()   Six in the fifth place means:
          Darkening of the light as with Prince Chi.
          Perseverance furthers.

     []   Six at the top means:
          Not light but darkness.
          First he climbed up to heaven,
          Then he plunged into the depths of the earth.
