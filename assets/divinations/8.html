     The Judgement

          Holding Together brings good fortune.
          Inquire of the oracle once again
          Whether you possess sublimity, constancy, and perseverance;
          Then there is no blame.
          Those who are uncertain gradually join.
          Whoever comes too late
          Meets with misfortune.

     The Image

          On the earth is water:
          The image of Holding Together.
          Thus the kings of antiquity
          Bestowed the different states as fiefs
          And cultivated friendly relations
          With the feudal lords.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          Hold to him in truth and loyalty;
          This is without blame.
          Truth, like a full earthen bowl:
          Thus in the end
          Good fortune comes from without.

          Six in the second place means:
          Hold to him inwardly.
          Perseverance brings good fortune.

          Six in the third place means:
          You hold together with the wrong people.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          Hold to him outwardly also.
          Perseverance brings good fortune.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          Manifestation of holding together.
          In the hunt the king uses beaters on three sides only
          And foregoes game that runs off in front.
          The citizens need no warning.
          Good fortune.

          Six at the top means:
          He finds no head for holding together.
          Misfortune.
