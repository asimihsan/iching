     The Judgement

          Preponderance of the Small. Success.
          Perseverance furthers.
          Small things may be done; great things should not be done.
          The flying bird brings the message:
          It is not well to strive upward,
          It is well to remain below.
          Great good fortune.

     The Image

          Thunder on the mountain:
          The image of Preponderance of the Small.
          Thus in his conduct the superior man gives preponderance to reverence.
          In bereavement he gives preponderance to grief.
          In his expenditures he gives preponderance to thrift.

     ()   Six in the fifth place means:
          Dense clouds,

          Six at the top means:
          He passes him by, not meeting him.
          The flying bird leaves him.
          Misfortune.
          This means bad luck and injury.
