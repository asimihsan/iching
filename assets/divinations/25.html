     The Judgement

          Innocence. Supreme success.
          Perseverance furthers.
          If someone is not as he should be,
          He has misfortune,
          And it does not further him
          To undertake anything.

     The Image

          Under heaven thunder rolls:
          All things attain the natural state of innocence.
          Thus the kings of old,
          Rich in virtue, and in harmony with the time,
          Fostered and nourished all beings.

     The Lines

     ()   Nine at the beginning means:
          Innocent behavior brings good fortune.

          Six in the second place means:
          If one does not count on the harvest while plowing,
          Nor on the use of the ground while clearing it,
          It furthers one to undertake something.

          Six in the third place means:
          Undeserved misfortune.
          The cow that was tethered by someone
          Is the wanderer's gain, the citizen's loss.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          He who can be persevering
          Remains without blame.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          Use no medicine in an illness
          Incurred through no fault of your own.
          It will pass of itself.

          Nine at the top means:
          Innocent action brings misfortune.
          Nothing furthers.
