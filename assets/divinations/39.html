     The Judgement

          Obstruction. The southwest furthers.
          The northeast does not further.
          It furthers one to see the great man.
          Perseverance brings good fortune.

     The Image

          Water on the mountain:
          The image of Obstruction.
          Thus the superior man turns his attention to himself
          And molds his character.

          In the midst of the greatest obstructions,
          Friends come.

          Six at the top means:

          Coming leads to great good fortune.
