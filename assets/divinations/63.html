     The Judgement

          After Completion. Success in small matters.
          Perseverance furthers.
          At the beginning good fortune,
          At the end disorder.

     The Image

          Water over fire: the image of the condition
          In After Completion.
          Thus the superior man
          Takes thought of misfortune
          And arms himself against it in advance.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          He brakes his wheels.
          He gets his tail in the water.
          No blame.

     ()   Six in the second place means:
          The woman loses the curtain of her carriage.
          Do not run after it;
          On the seventh day you will get it.

          Nine in the third place means:
          The Illustrious Ancestor
          Disciplines the Devil's Country.
          After three years he conquers it.
          Inferior people must not be employed.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          The finest clothes turn to rags.
          Be careful all day long.

          Nine in the fifth place means:
          The neighbor in the east who slaughters an ox
          Does not attain as much real happiness
          As the neighbor in the west
          With his small offering.

          Six at the top means:
          He gets his head in the water. Danger.
