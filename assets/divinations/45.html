     The Judgement

          Gathering Together. Success.
          The king approaches his temple.
          It furthers one to see the great man.
          This brings success. Perseverance furthers.
          To bring great offerings creates good fortune.
          It furthers one to undertake something.

     The Image

          Over the earth, the lake:
          The image of Gathering Together.
          Thus the superior man renews his weapons
          In order to meet the unforseen.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          If you are sincere, but not to the end,
          There will sometimes be confusion, sometimes gathering together.
          If you call out,
          Then after one grasp of the hand you can laugh again.
          Regret not. Going is without blame.

          Six in the second place means:
          Letting oneself be drawn
          Brings good fortune and remains blameless.
          If one is sincere,
          It furthers one to bring even a small offering.

          Six in the third place means:
          Gathering together amid sighs.
          Nothing that would further.
          Going is without blame.
          Slight humiliation.

     ()   Nine in the fourth place means:
          Great good fortune. No blame.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          If in gathering together one has position,
          This brings no blame.
          If there are some who are not yet sincerely in the work,
          Sublime and enduring perseverance is needed.
          Then remorse disappears.

          Six at the top means:
          Lamenting and sighing, floods of tears.
          No blame.
