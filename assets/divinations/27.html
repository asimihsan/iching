     The Judgement

          The Corners of the Mouth.
          Perseverance brings good fortune.
          Pay heed to the providing of nourishment
          And to what a man seeks
          To fill his own mouth with.

     The Image

          At the foot of the mountain, thunder:
          The image of Providing Nourishment.
          Thus the superior man is careful of his words
          And temperate in eating and drinking.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          You let your magic tortoise go,
          And look at me with the corners of your mouth drooping.
          Misfortune.

          Six in the second place means:
          Turning to the summit for nourishment,
          Deviating from the path
          To seek nourishment from the hill.
          Continuing to do this brings misfortune.

          Six in the third place means:
          Turning away from nourishment.
          Perseverance brings misfortune.
          Do not act thus for ten years.
          Nothing serves to further.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          Turning to the summit
          For provision of nourishment
          Brings good fortune.
          Spying about with sharp eyes
          Like a tiger with insatiable craving.
          No blame.

     ()   Six in the fifth place means:
          Turning away from the path.
          To remain persevering brings good fortune.
          One should not cross the great water.

     ()   Nine at the top means:
          The source of nourishment.
          Awareness of danger brings good fortune.
          It furthers one to cross the great water.
