     The Judgement

          Approach has supreme success.
          Perseverance furthers.
          When the eighth month comes,
          There will be misfortune.

     The Image

          The earth above the lake:
          The image of Approach.
          Thus the superior man is inexhaustible
          In his will to teach,
          And without limits
          In his tolerance and protection of the people.
