     The Judgement

          Coming to Meet. The maiden is powerful.
          One should not marry such a maiden.

     The Image

          Under heaven, wind:
          The image of Coming to Meet.
          Thus does the prince act when disseminating his commands
          And proclaiming them to the four quarters of heaven.

     The Lines

     []   Six at the beginning means:
          It must be checked with a brake of bronze.
          Perseverance brings good fortune.
          If one lets it take its course, one experiences misfortune.
          Even a lean pig has it in him to rage around.

     ()   Nine in the second place means:
          There is a fish in the tank. No blame.
          Does not further guests.

          Nine in the third place means:
          There is no skin on his thighs,
          And walking comes hard.
          If one is mindful of the danger,
          No great mistake is made.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          No fish in the tank.
          This leads to misfortune.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          A melon covered with willow leaves.
          Hidden lines.
          Then it drops down to one from heaven.

          Nine at the top means:
          He comes to meet with his horns.
          Humiliation. No blame.
