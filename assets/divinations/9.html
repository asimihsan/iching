     The Judgement

          The Taming Power of the Small
          Has success.
          Dense clouds, no rain from our western region.

     The Image

          The wind drives across heaven:
          The image of the Taming Power of the Small.
          Thus the superior man
          Refines the outward aspect of his nature.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          Return to the way.
          How could there be blame in this?
          Good fortune.

          Nine in the second place means:
          He allows himself to be drawn into returning.
          Good fortune.

          Nine in the third place means:
          The spokes burst out of the wagon wheels.
          Man and wife roll their eyes.

     []   Six in the fourth place means:
          If you are sincere, blood vanishes and fear gives way.
          No blame.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          If you are sincere and loyally attached,
          You are rich in your neighbor.

          Nine at the top means:
          The rain comes, there is rest.
          This is due to the lasting effect of character.
          Perseverance brings the woman into danger.
          The moon is nearly full.
          If the superior man persists,
          Misfortune comes.
