     The Judgement

          Grace has success.
          In small matters
          It is favorable to undertake something.

     The Image

          Fire at the foot of the mountain:
          The image of Grace.
          Thus does the superior man proceed
          When clearing up current affairs.
          But he dare not decide controversial issues in this way.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          He lends grace to his toes, leaves the carriage, and walks.

     ()   Six in the second place means:
          Lends grace to the beard on his chin.

          Nine in the third place means:
          Graceful and moist.
          Constant perseverance brings good fortune.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          Grace or simplicity?
          A white horse comes as if on wings.
          He is not a robber,
          He will woo at the right time.

          Six in the fifth place means:
          Grace in hills and gardens.
          The roll of silk is meager and small.
          Humiliation, but in the end good fortune.

     ()   Nine at the top means:
          Simple grace. No blame.
