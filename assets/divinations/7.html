     The Judgement

          The Army. The army needs perseverance
          And a strong man.
          Good fortune without blame.

     The Image

          In the middle of the earth is water:
          The image of the Army.
          Thus the superior man increases his masses
          By generosity toward the people.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          An army must set forth in proper order.
          If the order is not good, misfortune threatens.

     ()   Nine in the second place means:
          In the midst of the army.
          Good fortune. No blame.
          The king bestows a triple decoration.

          Six in the third place means:
          Perchance the army carries corpses in the wagon.
          Misfortune.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          The army retreats. No blame.

     ()   Six in the fifth place means:
          There is game in the field.
          It furthers one to catch it.
          Without blame.
          Let the eldest lead the army.
          The younger transports corpses;
          Then perseverance brings misfortune.

          Six at the top means:
          The great prince issues commands,
          Founds states, vests families with fiefs.
          Inferior people should not be employed.
