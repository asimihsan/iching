     The Judgement

          Splitting Apart. It does not further one
          To go anywhere.

     The Image

          The mountain rests on the earth:
          The image of Splitting Apart.
          Thus those above can ensure their position
          Only by giving generously to those below.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          The leg of the bed is split.
          Those who persevere are destroyed.
          Misfortune.

          Six in the second place means:
          The bed is split at the edge.
          Those who persevere are destroyed.
          Misfortune.

          Six in the third place means:
          He splits with them. No blame.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          The bed is split up to the skin.
          Misfortune.

          Six in the fifth place means:
          A shoal of fishes. Favor comes through the court ladies.
          Everything acts to further.

     ()   Nine at the top means:
          There is a large fruit still uneaten.
          The superior man receives a carriage.
          The house of the inferior man is split apart.
