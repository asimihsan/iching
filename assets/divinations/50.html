     The Judgement

          The Caldron. Supreme good fortune.
          Success.

     The Image

          Fire over wood:
          The image of the Caldron.
          Thus the superior man consolidates his fate
          By making his position correct.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          A ting with legs upturned.
          Furthers removal of stagnating stuff.
          One takes a concubine for the sake of her son.
          No blame.

          Nine in the second place means:
          There is food in the ting.
          My comrades are envious,
          But they cannot harm me.
          Good fortune.

          Nine in the third place means:
          The handle of the ting is altered.
          One is impeded in his way of life.
          The fat of the pheasant is not eaten.
          Once rain falls, remorse is spent.
          Good fortune comes in the end.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          The legs of the ting are broken.
          The prince's meal is spilled
          And his person is soiled.
          Misfortune.

     ()   Six in the fifth place means:
          The ting has yellow handles, golden carrying rings.
          Perseverance furthers.

     ()   Nine at the top means:
          The ting has rings of jade.
          Great good fortune.
          Nothing that would not act to further.
