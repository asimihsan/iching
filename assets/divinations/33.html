     The Judgement

          Retreat. Success.
          In what is small, perseverance furthers.

     The Image

          Mountain under heaven: the image of Retreat.
          Thus the superior man keeps the inferior man at a distance,
          Not angrily but with reserve.

     The Lines

     []   Six at the beginning means:
          At the tail in retreat. This is dangerous.
          One must not wish to undertake anything.

     []   Six in the second place means:
          He holds him fast with yellow oxhide.
          No one can tear him loose.

          Nine in the third place means:
          A halted retreat
          Is nerve-wracking and dangerous.
          To retain people as men- and maidservants
          Brings good fortune.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          Voluntary retreat brings good fortune to the superior man
          And downfall to the inferior man.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          Friendly retreat. Perseverance brings good fortune.

          Nine at the top means:
          Cheerful retreat. Everything serves to further.
