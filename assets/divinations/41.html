     The Judgement

          Decrease combined with sincerity
          Brings about supreme good fortune
          Without blame.
          One may be persevering in this.
          It furthers one to undertake something.
          How is this to be carried out?
          One may use two small bowls for the sacrifice.

     The Image

          At the foot of the mountain, the lake:
          The image of Decrease.
          Thus the superior man controls his anger
          And restrains his instincts.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          Going quickly when one's tasks are finished
          Is without blame.
          But one must reflect on how much one may decrease others.

          Nine in the second place means:
          Perseverance furthers.
          To undertake something brings misfortune.
          Without decreasing oneself,
          One is able to bring increase to others.

     []   Six in the third place means:
          When three people journey together,
          Their number decreases by one.
          When one man journeys alone,
          He finds a companion.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          If a man decreases his faults,
          It makes the other hasten to come and rejoice.
          No blame.

     ()   Six in the fifth place means:
          Someone does indeed increase him.
          Ten pairs of tortoises cannot oppose it.
          Supreme good fortune.

     []   Nine at the top means:
          If one is increased without depriving others,
          There is no blame.
          Perseverance brings good fortune.
          It furthers one to undertake something.
          One obtains servants
          But no longer has a separate home.
