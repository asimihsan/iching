     The Judgement

          The Clinging. Perseverance furthers.
          It brings success.
          Care of the cow brings good fortune.

     The Image

          That which is bright rises twice:
          The image of Fire.
          Thus the great man, by perpetuating this brightness,
          Illumines the four quarters of the world.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          The footprints run crisscross.
          If one is seriously intent, no blame.

     ()   Six in the second place means:
          Yellow light. Supreme good fortune.

          Nine in the third place means:
          In the light of the setting sun,
          Men either beat the pot and sing
          Or loudly bewail the approach of old age.
          Misfortune.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          Its coming is sudden;
          It flames up, dies down, is thrown away.

     ()   Six in the fifth place means:
          Tears in floods, sighing and lamenting.
          Good fortune.

          Nine at the top means:
          The king uses him to march forth and chastise.
          Then it is best to kill the leaders
          And take captive the followers. No blame.
