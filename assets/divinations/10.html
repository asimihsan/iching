     The Judgement

          Treading. Treading upon the tail of the tiger.
          It does not bite the man. Success.

     The Image

          Heaven above, the lake below:
          The image of Treading.
          Thus the superior man discriminates between high and low,
          And thereby fortifies the thinking of the people.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          Simple conduct. Progress without blame.

          Nine in the second place means:
          Treading a smooth, level course.
          The perseverance of a dark man
          Brings good fortune.

     []   Six in the third place means:
          A one-eyed man is able to see,
          A lame man is able to tread.
          He treads on the tail of the tiger.
          The tiger bites the man.
          Misfortune.
          Thus does a warrior act on behalf of his great prince.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          He treads on the tail of the tiger.
          Caution and circumspection
          Lead ultimately to good fortune.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          Resolute conduct.
          Perseverance with awareness of danger.

          Nine at the top means:
          Look to your conduct and weigh the favorable signs.
          When everything is fulfilled, supreme good fortune comes.
