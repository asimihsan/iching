     The Judgement

          Abundance has success.
          The king attains abundance.
          Be not sad.
          Be like the sun at midday.

     The Image

          Both thunder and lightning come:
          The image of Abundance.
          Thus the superior man decides lawsuits
          And carries out punishments.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          When a man meets his destined ruler,
          They can be together ten days,
          And it is not a mistake.
          Going meets with recognition.

          Six in the second place means:
          The curtain is of such fullness
          That the polestars can be seen at noon.
          Through going one meets with mistrust and hate.
          If one rouses him through truth,
          Good fortune comes.

          Nine in the third place means:
          The underbrush is of such abundance
          That the small stars can be seen at noon.
          He breaks his right arm. No blame.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          The curtain is of such fullness
          That the polestars can be seen at noon.
          He meets his ruler, who is of like kind.
          Good fortune.

     ()   Six in the fifth place means:
          Lines are coming,
          Blessing and fame draw near.
          Good fortune.

          Six at the top means:
          His house is in a state of abundance.
          He screens off his family.
          He peers through the gate
          And no longer perceives anyone.
          For three years he sees nothing.
          Misfortune.
