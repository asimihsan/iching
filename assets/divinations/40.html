     The Judgement

          Deliverance. The southwest furthers.
          If there is no longer anything where one has to go,
          Return brings good fortune.
          If there is still something where one has to go,
          Hastening brings good fortune.

     The Image

          Thunder and rain set in:
          The image of Deliverance.
          Thus the superior man pardons mistakes
          And forgives misdeeds.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          Without blame.

     ()   Nine in the second place means:
          One kills three foxes in the field
          And receives a yellow arrow.
          Perseverance brings good fortune.

          Six in the third place means:
          If a man carries a burden on his back
          And nonetheless rides in a carriage,
          He thereby encourages robbers to draw near.
          Perseverance leads to humiliation.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          Deliver yourself from your great toe.
          Then the companion comes,
          And him you can trust.

     ()   Six in the fifth place means:
          If only the superior man can deliver himself,
          It brings good fortune.
          Thus he proves to inferior men that he is in earnest.

          Six at the top means:
          The prince shoots at a hawk on a high wall.
          He kills it. Everything serves to further.
