     The Judgement

          Duration. Success. No blame.
          Perseverance furthers.
          It furthers one to have somewhere to go.

     The Image

          Thunder and wind: the image of Duration.
          Thus the superior man stands firm
          And does not change his direction.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          Seeking duration too hastily brings misfortune persistently.
          Nothing that would further.

     ()   Nine in the second place means:
          Remorse disappears.

          Nine in the third place means:
          He who does not give duration to his character
          Meets with disgrace.
          Persistent humiliation.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          No game in the field.

          Six in the fifth place means:
          Giving duration to one's character through perseverance.
          This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man.

          Six at the top means:
          Restlessness as an enduring condition brings misfortune.
