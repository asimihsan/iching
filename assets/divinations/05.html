     The Judgement

          Waiting. If you are sincere,
          You have light and success.
          Perseverance brings good fortune.
          It furthers one to cross the great water.

     The Image

          Clouds rise up to heaven:
          The image of Waiting.
          Thus the superior man eats and drinks,
          Is joyous and of good cheer.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          Waiting in the meadow.
          It furthers one to abide in what endures.
          No blame.

          Nine in the second place means:
          Waiting on the sand.
          There is some gossip.
          The end brings good fortune.

          Nine in the third place means:
          Waiting in the mud
          Brings about the arrival of the enemy.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          Waiting in blood.
          Get out of the pit.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          Waiting at meat and drink.
          Perseverance brings good fortune.

          Six at the top means:
          One falls into the pit.
          Three uninvited guests arrive.
          Honor them, and in the end there will be good fortune.
