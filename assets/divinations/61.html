     The Judgement

          Inner Truth. Pigs and fishes.
          Good fortune.
          It furthers one to cross the great water.
          Perseverance furthers.

     The Image

          Wind over lake: the image of Inner Truth.
          Thus the superior man discusses criminal cases
          In order to delay executions.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          Being prepared brings good fortune.
          If there are secret designs, it is disquieting.

          Nine in the second place means:
          A crane calling in the shade.
          Its young answers it.
          I have a good goblet.
          I will share it with you.

     []   Six in the third place means:
          He finds a comrade.
          Now he beats the drum, now he stops.
          Now he sobs, now he sings.

     []   Six in the fourth place means:
          The moon nearly at the full.
          The team horse goes astray.
          No blame.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          He possesses truth, which links together.
          No blame.

          Nine at the top means:
          Cockcrow penetrating to heaven.
          Perseverance brings misfortune.
