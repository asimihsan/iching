     The Judgement

          Biting Through has success.
          It is favorable to let justice be administered.

     The Image

          Thunder and lightning:
          The image of Biting Through.
          Thus the kings of former times made firm the laws
          Through clearly defined penalties.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          His feet are fastened in the stocks,
          So that his toes disappear.
          No blame.

          Six in the second place means:
          Bites through tender meat,
          So that his nose disappears.
          No blame.

          Six in the third place means:
          Bites on old dried meat
          And strikes on something poisonous.
          Slight humiliation. No blame.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          Bites on dried gristly meat.
          Receives metal arrows.
          It furthers one to be mindful of difficulties
          And to be persevering.
          Good fortune.

     ()   Six in the fifth place means:
          Bites on dried lean meat.
          Receives yellow gold.
          Perseveringly aware of danger.
          No blame.

          Nine at the top means:
          His neck is fastened in the wooden cangue,
          So that his ears disappear.
          Misfortune.
