     The Judgement

          Peace. The small departs,
          The great approaches.
          Good fortune. Success.

     The Image

          Heaven and earth unite: the image of Peace.
          Thus the ruler
          Divides and completes the course of heaven and earth;
          He furthers and regulates the gifts of heaven and earth,
          And so aids the people.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          When ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it.
          Each according to his kind.
          Undertakings bring good fortune.

     ()   Nine in the second place means:
          Bearing with the uncultured in gentleness,
          Fording the river with resolution,
          Not neglecting what is distant,
          Not regarding one's companions:
          Thus one may manage to walk in the middle.

          Nine in the third place means:
          No plain not followed by a slope.
          No going not followed by a return.
          He who remains persevering in danger
          Is without blame.
          Do not complain about this truth;
          Enjoy the good fortune you still possess.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          He flutters down, not boasting of his wealth,
          Together with his neighbor,
          Guileless and sincere.

     ()   Six in the fifth place means:
          The sovereign I
          Gives his daughter in marriage.
          This brings blessing
          And supreme good fortune.

          Six at the top means:
          The wall falls back into the moat.
          Use no army now.
          Make your commands known within your own town.
          Perseverance brings humiliation.
