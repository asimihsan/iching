     The Judgement

          Standstill. Evil people do not further
          The perseverance of the superior man.
          The great departs; the small approaches.

     The Image

          Heaven and earth do not unite:
          The image of Standstill.
          Thus the superior man falls back upon his inner worth
          In order to escape the difficulties.
          He does not permit himself to be honored with revenue.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          When ribbon grass is pulled up, the sod comes with it.
          Each according to his kind.
          Perseverance brings good fortune and success.

     []   Six in the second place means:
          They bear and endure;
          This means good fortune for inferior people.
          The standstill serves to help the great man to attain success.

          Six in the third place means:
          They bear shame.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          He who acts at the command of the highest
          Remains without blame.
          Those of like mind partake of the blessing.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          Standstill is giving way.
          Good fortune for the great man.
          "What if it should fail, what if it should fail?"
          In this way he ties it to a cluster of mulberry shoots.

          Nine at the top means:
          The standstill comes to an end.
          First standstill, then good fortune.
