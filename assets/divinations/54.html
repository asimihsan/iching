     The Judgement

          The Marrying Maiden.
          Undertakings bring misfortune.
          Nothing that would further.

     The Image

          Thunder over the lake:
          The image of the Marrying Maiden.
          Thus the superior man
          Understands the transitory
          In the light of the eternity of the end.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          The marrying maiden as a concubine.
          A lame man who is able to tread.
          Undertakings bring good fortune.

          Nine in the second place means:
          A one-eyed man who is able to see.
          The perseverance of a solitary man furthers.

     []   Six in the third place means:
          The marrying maiden as a slave.
          She marries as a concubine.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          The marrying maiden draws out the allotted time.
          A late marriage comes in due course.

     ()   Six in the fifth place means:
          The sovereign I gave his daughter in marriage.
          The embroidered garments of the princess
          Were not as gorgeous
          As those of the servingmaid.
          The moon that is nearly full
          Brings good fortune.

     []   Six at the top means:
          The woman holds the basket, but there are no fruits in it.
          The man stabs the sheep, but no blood flows.
          Nothing that acts to further.
