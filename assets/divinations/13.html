     The Judgement

          Fellowship with Men in the open.
          Success.
          It furthers one to cross the great water.
          The perseverance of the superior man furthers.

     The Image

          Heaven together with fire:
          The image of Fellowship with Men.
          Thus the superior man organizes the clans
          And makes distinctions between things.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          Fellowship with men at the gate.
          No blame.

     ()   Six in the second place means:
          Fellowship with men in the clan.
          Humiliation.

          Nine in the third place means:
          He hides weapons in the thicket;
          He climbs the high hill in front of it.
          For three years he does not rise up.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          He climbs up on his wall; he cannot attack.
          Good fortune.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          Men bound in fellowship first weep and lament,
          But afterward they laugh.
          After great struggles they succeed in meeting.

          Nine at the top means:
          Fellowship with men in the meadow.
          No remorse.
