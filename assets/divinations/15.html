     The Judgement

          Modesty creates success.
          The superior man carries things through.

     The Image

          Within the earth, a mountain:
          The image of Modesty.
          Thus the superior man reduces that which is too much,
          And augments that which is too little.
          He weighs things and makes them equal.

          A superior man of modesty and merit
          Carries things to conclusion.
          Good fortune.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          Nothing that would not further modesty
          In movement.

          Six in the fifth place means:
          No boasting of wealth before one's neighbor.
          It is favorable to attack with force.
          Nothing that would not further.

          Six at the top means:
          Modesty that comes to expression.
          It is favorable to set armies marching
          To chastise one's own city and one's country.
