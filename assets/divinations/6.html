     The Judgement

          Conflict. You are sincere
          And are being obstructed.
          A cautious halt halfway brings good fortune.
          Going through to the end brings misfortune.
          It furthers one to see the great man.
          It does not further one to cross the great water.

     The Image

          Heaven and water go their opposite ways:
          The image of Conflict.
          Thus in all his transactions the superior man
          Carefully considers the beginning.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          If one does not perpetuate the affair,
          There is a little gossip.
          In the end, good fortune comes.

          Nine in the second place means:
          One cannot engage in conflict;
          One returns home, gives way.
          The people of his town,
          Three hundred households,
          Remain free of guilt.

          Six in the third place means:
          To nourish oneself on ancient virtue induces perseverance.
          Danger. In the end, good fortune comes.
          If by chance you are in the service of a king,
          Seek not works.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          One cannot engage in conflict.
          One turns back and submits to fate,
          Changes one's attitude,
          And finds peace in perseverance.
          Good fortune.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          To contend before him
          Brings supreme good fortune.

          Nine at the top means:
          Even if by chance a leather belt is bestowed on one,
          By the end of a morning
          It will have been snatched away three times.
