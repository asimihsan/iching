     The Judgement

          The Receptive brings about sublime success,
          Furthering through the perseverance of a mare.
          If the superior man undertakes something and tries to lead,
          He goes astray;
          But if he follows, he finds guidance.
          It is favorable to find friends in the west and south,
          To forego friends in the east and north.
          Quiet perseverance brings good fortune.

     The Image

          The earth's condition is receptive devotion.
          Thus the superior man who has breadth of character
          Carries the outer world.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          When there is hoarfrost underfoot,
          Solid ice is not far off.

     ()   Six in the second place means:
          Straight, square, great.
          Without purpose,
          Yet nothing remains unfurthered.

          Six in the third place means:
          Hidden lines.
          One is able to remain persevering.
          If by chance you are in the service of a king,
          Seek not works, but bring to completion.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          A tied-up sack. No blame, no praise.

          Six in the fifth place means:
          A yellow lower garment brings supreme good fortune.

          Six at the top means:
          Dragons fight in the meadow.
          Their blood is black and yellow.

          When all the lines are sixes, it means:
          Lasting perseverance furthers.
