     The Judgement

          The Abysmal repeated.
          If you are sincere, you have success in your heart,
          And whatever you do succeeds.

     The Image

          Water flows on uninterruptedly and reaches its goal:
          The image of the Abysmal repeated.
          Thus the superior man walks in lasting virtue
          And carries on the business of teaching.

     The Lines

          Six at the beginning means:
          Repetition of the Abysmal.
          In the abyss one falls into a pit.
          Misfortune.

     ()   Nine in the second place means:
          The abyss is dangerous.
          One should strive to attain small things only.

          Six in the third place means:
          Forward and backward, abyss on abyss.
          In danger like this, pause at first and wait,
          Otherwise you will fall into a pit in the abyss.
          Do not act in this way.

          Six in the fourth place means:
          A jug of wine, a bowl of rice with it;
          Earthen vessels
          Simply handed in through the window.
          There is certainly no blame in this.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          The abyss is not filled to overflowing,
          It is filled only to the rim.
          No blame.

          Six at the top means:
          Bound with cords and ropes,
          Shut in between thorn-hedged prison walls:
          For three years one does not find the way.
          Misfortune.
