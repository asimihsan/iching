     The Judgement

          Revolution. On your own day
          You are believed.
          Supreme success,
          Furthering through perseverance.
          Remorse disappears.

     The Image

          Fire in the lake: the image of Revolution.
          Thus the superior man
          Sets the calendar in order
          And makes the seasons clear.

     The Lines

          Nine at the beginning means:
          Wrapped in the hide of a yellow cow.

          Six in the second place means:
          When one's own day comes, one may create revolution.
          Starting brings good fortune. No blame.

          Nine in the third place means:
          Starting brings misfortune.
          Perseverance brings danger.
          When talk of revolution has gone the rounds three times,
          One may commit himself,
          And men will believe him.

          Nine in the fourth place means:
          Remorse disappears. Men believe him.
          Changing the form of government brings good fortune.

     ()   Nine in the fifth place means:
          The great man changes like a tiger.
          Even before he questions the oracle
          He is believed.

          Six at the top means:
          The superior man changes like a panther.
          The inferior man molts in the face.
          Starting brings misfortune.
          To remain persevering brings good fortune.
